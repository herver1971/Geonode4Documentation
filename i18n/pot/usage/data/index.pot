msgid "Data management tools built into GeoNode allow integrated creation of resources eg datasets, documents, link to external documents, map visualizations and other configured geonode apps. Each resource in the system can be shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users. Social features like user profiles and commenting and rating systems allow for the development of communities around each platform to facilitate the use, management, and quality control of the data the GeoNode instance contains."
